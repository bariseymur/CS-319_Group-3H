# Project Description

In this project we will be making a tower defense game. Tower Defense is a subgenre of strategy games. The main aim of the game is not to let the enemies pass the gates of your kingdom. In the game there will be different levels with different monster types that have different attributes, which will be a challenge for the player. Attackers will follow a path to reach their target, which is the defenders base. The defender will try to kill the attackers before they reach their target by using guard towers. Also player will have access to various kinds of towers with different working mechanisms. Defender need to prevent attackers from reaching the base to win.
